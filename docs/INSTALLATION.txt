# How to Install This Chrome/Chromium Extension

1. **Extract the ZIP**
   - Unzip the archive. You will get a folder named like `snag-for-audius-v1.0.0`.
   - Inside, you will find a folder called `extension`.

2. **Open Chrome/Chromium**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser's address bar.

3. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Toggle the switch in the top right corner labeled "Developer mode".

4. **Load Unpacked**
   - Click the "Load unpacked" button.
   - In the file dialog, select the `extension` folder you extracted.

5. **Done!**
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list and be ready to use.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Make sure you select the `extension` folder, not the parent folder.
- If you see errors, ensure all files were extracted and you are using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc).
